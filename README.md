# PANELSTAT: Descriptive statistics for panels

`panelstat` is a [Stata](http://www.stata.com/) tool to explore unbalanced panel data sets. The software was developed to provide a detailed understanding of a panel data set. The options that were added reflect particular needs felt by the restricted group of users at BPlim - the microdata laboratory at the Banco de Portugal.
No attention has been given to formatting of outputs.

## Install:

`panelstat` is not in SSC. To install run the following in Stata:

net install panelstat, from("https://github.com/pguimaraes99/panelstat/master/")
