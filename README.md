Descriptive statistics for panels
Panelstat is a Stata tool to explore unbalanced panel data sets. 
The software is intended to provide a detailed understanding of a panel data set.
The options that were added reflect particular needs felt by the restricted group of users at BPlim - the microdata
laboratory at the Banco de Portugal. No attention has been given to formatting outputs.
